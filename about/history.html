        <p>Anyone got a lecture clash? They're not pretty, but with your help, they can be manageable. Here are some thoughts on how to deal with it: â€¢ Realise that it's up to you. You are responsible for making it work.
            <ul>
                <li>Attend one lecture and get the notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's not enough).</li>
                <li>Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that's not on the web.</li>
                <li>Which one do you miss? - Some ideas to help you with that decision are:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3 that's 33%.</li>
                    <li>Which one are you most on top of?</li>
                    <li>Which subject has the most complete lecture notes?</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Don't ask your lecturer - "did I miss anything in the lecture?" If you didn't miss anything, there'd be no point to lectures.</li>
            </ul>
